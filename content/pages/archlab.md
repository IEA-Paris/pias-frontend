**The archlab is a work in progress** but you didn't come for nothing! Here is a
first vizualisation of the full academic scope of the PIAS fields taxonomy. It
is based on the complete [Wikipedia list of academic
fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_fields) and leads to the
related wikipedia page, info and description. We plan to use a similar
[dataviz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_and_information_visualization) to
display the articles, authors and media with one entry for the fields, themes,
or types of content and another for the content itself, other data analytics
vizualisation or simply the number of downloads of the related PDF(s).
