**The Proceedings of the Institutes for Advanced Study (PIAS)** is a joint effort of several Institutes for Advanced Study to **publish** and **promote** their respective activities.

**PIAS** has been initated by **[Paris IAS](https://www.paris-iea.fr/en/)**. It is a archipelago of proceedings websites powered by **[publi.io](https://publi.io)**, a state-of-the-art, multilingual, free, open-source and easy to use platform that promotes open science.

This website has initially been designed to present PIAS to the community. We also added the **[archlab](/archlab)**, a little analytics experiment to draw a map of the current academic landcape in terms of fields, thematics and dissemination within the PIAS proceedings (and someday maybe at a larger scale, who knows?).

**PIAS** is based solely on open standards and goes by the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/) principles.

You can browse our our proceedings [here](/proceedings). If you are representing an Institute for Advanced Study and PIAS is interesting to you, [contact us](/contact)!
